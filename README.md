## Live and deployed application 
https://riley-text-editor.onrender.com/

## Description
I decided to build a text editor so users can create notes or add snippets. This application can be very beneficial to note takers as it allows users to create notes on a browser even when they are offline. A install button is featured and is is used for those who want to download their work to their device. I enjoyed working on this application as it was a great way to work with PWA's and the technologies commonly used with it. 

## Installation
You can install this with git bash by typing in 'git clone _Replace this with link_' to wherever you want the repository to be installed on your computer.

## Usage
To use this application you first want to open the root directory of the repository in your terminal or bash. You can start the bundle by typing in `npm run build`. From there you want to start the server with `npn run start`. You want to then go to the link that is being used. This is typically local host with the port number. From there you can view the page and use the features available.
