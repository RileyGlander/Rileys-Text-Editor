## Description
I decided to build a text editor so users can create notes or add snippets. This application can be very beneficial to note takers as it allows users to create notes on a browser even when they are offline. A install button is featured and is is used for those who want to download their work to their device. I enjoyed working on this application as it was a great way to work with Progessive web application and to understand the pieces behind it. 

## Installation
You can install this with git bash by typing in 'git clone Replace this with link' to wherever you want the repository to be installed on your computer.

## Usage
This page has already been set up with render so it's as simple as viewing the page https://riley-text-editor.onrender.com and using it as needed.
